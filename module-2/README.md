##GPIO Adventures

Hello. For Task 1 of Module 2, I utilized all three components (button, switch, joystick) and had three modes of operation.

It's very simple using `gpiozero`. Pushing the button cycles between three states:

- Up on the stick prints a '.', the switch prints an 'A', and left on the stick prints a '<'.
- Up on the stick prints a '!', the switch prints an 'B', and left on the stick prints a '<'.
- Up on the stick prints a '?', the switch prints an 'C', and left on the stick prints a '='.

Check the `module-2-gpios.py` script and set up the GPIOs with the corresponding pins to test it out.
